# Code Prompt Prep (CPP)

**Prepare project files for AI assistance by minifying and organizing code.**

---

## ‚ö° Overview

`Code Prompt Prep (CPP)` is a CLI tool designed to streamline project file preparation for AI-powered tools or other use cases where concise, well-structured code is critical.

### Why is this Useful?

When interacting with AI tools, providing concise and relevant context is key to obtaining accurate and meaningful outputs. Large, unstructured codebases can overwhelm AI tools or lead to irrelevant responses. `Code Prompt Prep` solves this by generating **plain-text, minified versions of your code**, making it:

- **Easier to fit within input token limits.**
- **Faster to process for the AI.**
- **More focused**, reducing noise from unnecessary comments, whitespaces, or excluded files.

Whether you're using AI for debugging, documentation, or code generation, this tool ensures that only the essential parts of your project are included in the prompt or context.

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Command

```bash
cpp --project-path <path_to_project> [options]
```

### Examples

1. **Process all files in the current directory**:

   ```bash
   cpp --project-path .
   ```

2. **Include only `.ts` and `.js` files**:

   ```bash
   cpp --project-path ./src --include-extensions .ts,.js
   ```

3. **Exclude `node_modules` and `dist` folders**:

   ```bash
   cpp --project-path ./ --exclude-folders node_modules,dist
   ```

4. **Limit concurrency to 2 for slower systems**:

   ```bash
   cpp --project-path ./ --concurrency 2
   ```

### Help Command

```bash
cpp --help
```

  -ie, --include-extensions <list>
                                  File extensions to include (comma-separated, must start with dot)
  -id, --include-folders <list>   Folders to include (comma-separated folder paths)
  -xf, --exclude-files <list>     Files to exclude (comma-separated file paths)
  -xe, --exclude-extensions <list>

## üõ† Configuration

### Filters

You can customize which files or folders to include/exclude using the following options:

- **Include Options**:

  - `--include-files`: Specify exact file paths to include.
  - `--include-extensions`: Specify file extensions (e.g., `.js`, `.ts`).
  - `--include-folders`: Include entire folders.

- **Exclude Options**:
  - `--exclude-files`: Specify exact file paths to exclude.
  - `--exclude-extensions`: Specify file extensions to exclude.
  - `--exclude-folders`: Exclude entire folders.

### Output

The processed files are saved in the specified output folder (default: `_ai_output`) with a timestamped `.txt` file. This plain-text file can then be directly copied into an AI prompt or used as context when interacting with AI tools.

## üîí Graceful Handling of Interruptions

The tool ensures:

- **Spinners and progress indicators are stopped.**
- **Incomplete output files are cleaned up automatically.**
- **Active buffers are safely closed.**

This means that if you interrupt the process (e.g., pressing `Ctrl+C`), `Code Prompt Prep` will handle the cleanup without requiring any manual intervention.
